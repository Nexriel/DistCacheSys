# System Architecture Overview

## Core Components

### 1. Cache Layer
- In-memory storage
- Expiration handling
- Thread-safe operations

### 2. Distribution Layer
- Node management
- Data partitioning
- Replication

### 3. Metrics System
- Performance monitoring
- Statistics collection
- Real-time reporting

## Data Flow

1. Client Request → Load Balancer
2. Load Balancer → Cache Node
3. Cache Node → Storage/Memory
4. Response → Client

## Performance Considerations

- Lock-free operations
- Memory management
- Network optimization
